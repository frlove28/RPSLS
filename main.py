# Algorithms

# will need user input(): bad user input???

#  As a player, I want the game of RPSLS to be at minimum a 
# “best of three” to decide a winner. ( while loop, random.choice, if/ else statement )

# show that a player wins each round


# enter all hand gestures as a string


# determine parent/ child class

# commits throughout 


# define rules of game


# # make sure we have defined classes


# after mvp


# create a class for each gesture (separate files)










# Main Stories


# (5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 10 commits with descriptive messages.


# (15 points): As a developer, I want to find a way to properly incorporate inheritance into my game.  (define super class)


# (5 points): As a developer, I want to account for and handle bad user input, ensuring that any user 
# input is validated and reobtained if necessary.


# (10 points): As a developer, I want to store all of the gesture options/choices in a
# List (AS STRINGS).


# I want to find a way to utilize the list of gestures within my code 
# (display gesture options, assign player a gesture, etc).
# NOTE: Do not use a Gesture class until you have reached MVP for all user stories and been checked off by an instructor!


# (10 points): As a player, I want the correct player to win a given round based on the choices made by each player. 
# See below for game rules!


# (10 points): As a player, I want the game of RPSLS to be at minimum a “best of three” to decide a winner.
